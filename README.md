# Algotia Documentation

This is the repository containing the documentation for
[Algotia](https://www.github.com/Algotia/Algotia). 


## How to edit and build the documentation

The documentation is built using a library called [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/),
in order to build the documentation, please follow the installation guide for
MkDocs.

- **Structure**

All `.md` files in the `docs/` folder is a single page of documentation. Simply
edit a markdown file and MkDocs will take care of the rest.

- **Development server**

> MkDocs comes with a built-in dev-server that lets you preview your documentation as you work on it. Make sure you're in the same directory as the mkdocs.yml configuration file, and then start the server by running the `mkdocs serve` command:
>
> ```bash
> $ mkdocs serve
> INFO    -  Building documentation...
> INFO    -  Cleaning site directory
> [I 160402 15:50:43 server:271] Serving on http://127.0.0.1:8000
> [I 160402 15:50:43 handlers:58] Start watching changes
> [I 160402 15:50:43 handlers:60] Start detecting changes
> ```
